<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Randolph Bolie; I'm an Information Technology Student at Georgia Southern University, specializing in Cybersecurity. I was born in Monrovia, Liberia, and came to the United States at six. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, with my sister and parents. During my childhood, I grew up playing basketball and Football.

<p>My career goal is to start as a Junior Information Security Analyst and eventually move up higher in the chambers of Information Security. I hope to one day become a penetration tester and be able to help many companies around the globe secure cyber attacks. I'm very passionate about learning how to secure against cyber attacks. </p>

<p>My favorite things to do whenever I'm not focusing on Information Security is to exercise and hang out with my family members. I love watching movies on Netflix and playing chess on my computer. Overall by far, the most important habit for me is to sleep.</p>
